# Trading-Chatbot

# problem statement
As a global player in cryptocurrency trading, Ananda Exchange needs actionable insights from vast and complex trading data. Existing models struggle to keep pace with the dynamic and volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets. This project aims to develop advanced analytics and predictive tools to interpret trading signals, identify market opportunities, and mitigate risks effectively.

# Chatbot

This section details the comprehensive approach used to evaluate, configure, and optimize various open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) for developing a high-performance chatbot tailored to cryptocurrency support. The methodology includes model selection, the development of chatbots with distinct configurations, integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and the evaluation of each configuration’s performance based on established metrics.

**1. Open-Source LLM Selection and Evaluation**

Initial exploration included a broad range of open-source LLMs, with evaluation based on computational efficiency, response accuracy, and compatibility with cryptocurrency-related inquiries. Following a detailed assessment, Llama, Mistral, Gemma, and XGen were selected as the final LLMs for chatbot development. These models were chosen due to their strengths in handling complex queries, efficient resource usage, and adaptability for crypto-specific language.

•	Llama: Selected for its resource efficiency, making it ideal for lightweight deployments without sacrificing performance.

•	Mistral: Known for balancing processing demands with high memory efficiency, particularly suited to chatbot implementations requiring ongoing context retention.

•	Gemma: Offers strong multilingual support, ensuring accessibility to a diverse user base within the cryptocurrency community.

•	XGen: Recognized for its versatility and capability to process a broad range of queries, making it a reliable choice for diverse crypto-related inquiries.

**2. Chatbot Development Across Configurations**

To comprehensively assess each LLM’s capabilities, three chatbot configurations were developed for each finalized model:
•	Standard LLM-Based Chatbot:

o	This chatbot configuration leverages a selected LLM in isolation, without any retrieval mechanisms. The user’s prompt is processed directly by the LLM, which generates a response based solely on its training. The model can recall recent interactions within a session, allowing for continuity in conversation. This configuration serves as the baseline, offering insights into the LLM’s performance without augmented data.

•	LLM-Based Chatbot with RAG Integration:

o	This configuration includes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to enhance response relevance by grounding outputs in real-time data. Upon receiving a user prompt, the chatbot searches for relevant information within RAG-supported documents, processing these as data chunks. If relevant data is found, it is combined with the prompt before being processed by the LLM, enhancing factual accuracy. If no relevant data is retrieved, the chatbot falls back to a standard LLM-based response. This setup reduces the risk of hallucinations and improves the chatbot's ability to deliver reliable, data-backed answers.

•	LLM-Based Chatbot with RAG and Tailored Response Mechanism:

o	For this advanced configuration, the chatbot is optimized to deliver responses closely aligned with standardized answers for frequently asked questions. When a prompt is given, the chatbot searches for semantically similar questions within RAG-provided documents. If an exact or closely related match is found, the chatbot responds with the exact text from the document. If no match exists, the system searches for related data and combines it with the prompt for processing, similar to the RAG-only configuration. This setup ensures that commonly asked questions receive consistent, accurate responses, particularly valuable for high-stakes, factual information in the cryptocurrency domain.

**3. Comparative Evaluation of Chatbot Configurations**

After developing these configurations for each LLM (Llama, Mistral, Gemma, and XGen), a comparative evaluation will be conducted to identify the optimal model setup. Performance will measured against standard responses using the following metrics:

•	BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy Score): Measures word overlap between the chatbot’s response and standard answers, where higher scores indicate closer lexical similarity.

•	ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation): Evaluates recall of n-grams within responses, utilizing ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores to capture different n-gram recalls.

•	BERT Score: Assesses semantic similarity based on embeddings, making it particularly suited for LLM evaluation where meaning over exact words is significant.

•	Cosine Similarity (Embedding): Calculates similarity in the embedding space, typically utilizing Sentence Transformers or similar embeddings, providing insights into overall alignment with intended answers.

The comparative results from each LLM configuration will be analyzed to determine the best-performing chatbot setup, particularly in terms of accuracy and response quality for cryptocurrency-related queries.

**4. Final Selection and Deployment Preparations**

Based on the comparative evaluation, the configuration demonstrating the highest accuracy and consistency with standard responses will be selected for deployment. This finalized chatbot will be integrated into a user-friendly interface (UI) designed for accessibility across Ananda Exchange’s platform, enabling efficient, 24/7 support. Final deployment preparations focused on ensuring seamless performance across devices, aligning with the goal of delivering reliable user experience for cryptocurrency support.

This methodology outlines each step of the approach, including model selection, configuration development, and performance assessment, ensuring clarity and reproducibility for stakeholders. Each section provides insights into not only the actions taken but also the rationale, making this approach adaptable to similar applications in cryptocurrency and beyond.
